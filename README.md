Magento Discount Sticker Extension
==================================

Adds a ready-to-use block to show discount rate of products in Magento.

Usage
-----

Simply install the exentions with `modman` or `composer`. Then you can add the discount sticker block by adding these lines in your `.phtml` files:

```
<?php
  $this
	->getLayout()
    ->createBlock(
      Webgriffe_DiscountSticker_Block_DiscountSticker::BLOCK_ALIAS
	)
    ->setProduct($_product)
    ->toHtml();
?>
```

Where `$_product` is a `Mage_Catalog_Model_Product` instance of the product on which you want to display the discount.

If you want you can override default discount sticker template by overriding `catalog/product/list/discount_sticker.phtml` in your theme.
